**Private EKS with Internal Application (Terraform + Kubernetes)**

Project Summary

This project demonstrates how to design and deploy a secure, private Amazon EKS cluster using Terraform, and run an internal application stack (HAProxy + Tomcat) without exposing any public endpoints.
The focus is on security, controlled access, and production-style architecture, not public demos.
